# Node.js: Team Profile Generator (Employee Summary)

## Description
This is a command-line node.js application that dynamically generates a software engineering team profile from a user's input using the Inquirer package. 

In this repository ("Team Profile Generator"), I have created a command-line application (as part of my assignment for UofT SCS Coding Boot Camp Course) that dynamically generates a software engineering team roster.
The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

Technologies Used: JavaScript, Node.js, npm, Inquirer, jest

## Installation

- To install this code, download the zip file and extract the files to a designated directory on your Node.js server without changing the directory/folder structure, or use GitHub's guidelines to clone the repository. 
- Install node.js, npm, Inquirer, jest packages 

## Usage 

The application can be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node app.js
